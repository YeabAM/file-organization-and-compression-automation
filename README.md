# File Organizer & Compressor

This project is a Python automation script that helps you organize files in your current working directory based on their file types. Additionally, it provides the capability to compress files into zip archives for better storage management. The script is designed to be simple and efficient, running directly from the command line.

## Overview

Managing a cluttered directory with mixed file types can be tedious and time-consuming. This Python script automates the organization of files by categorizing them into folders based on their extensions (e.g., images, documents, videos). It also includes an optional feature to compress files into a zip archive, reducing the amount of disk space they occupy.

By running this script in your desired directory, all files will be neatly organized and compressed, making it easier to maintain and manage your files.

## Technology

- **Python:** The script is written in Python, making use of standard libraries for file manipulation and compression.
- **OS Module:** Used to interact with the operating system and handle file and directory operations.
- **Shutil Module:** Utilized for moving files and creating directories.
- **Zipfile Module:** Provides the compression functionality, allowing the script to create zip archives of files.

## Features

- **File Organization:** Automatically sorts and moves files into folders based on their file types.
- **Compression:** Optionally compresses files into zip archives, reducing their size and making them easier to store.
- **Command-Line Interface:** The script is designed to be run from the command line, working with the files in the current directory.
